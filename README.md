# Litematica Block Changer
Have you ever downloaded a Schematic just to find out that one Block type is wrong? Me too! That's because I created this Python Prompt Based Litematica Block Changer for you to use :)

## Requirements

Python 3.6 or higher
nbtlib library for NBT file handling

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository
```python
git clone https://github.com/codebooo/Litematica-Block-Changer
cd Litematic-Clock-Replacer
```

2. Install required dependencies
```python
pip install nbtlib
```
Or if you prefer using pip3:
```python
pip3 install nbtlib
```
## Usage

1. Run the script
```python
python litematic_replacer.py
```
or
```python
python3 litematic_replacer.py
```
3. Follow the interactive prompts:

- Enter the path to your .litematic file
- View the list of blocks found in the schematic
- Select the block to replace (by number or name)
- Enter the replacement block name
- Confirm the replacement

Questions you'll never have to ask again:
- Replacing all of one block type with another block type?
- It is possible to replace all of one block type with another block type?
- Replace litematica blocks
- Material List Changer Litematica?
- Help me I wanna replace a material from litematica
