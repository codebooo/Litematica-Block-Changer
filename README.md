# Litematica-Block-Changer
Have you ever downloaded a Schematic just to find out that one Block type is wrong? Me too! That's because I created this Python Prompt Based Litematica Block Changer for you to use :)

pip install nbtlib
```
Or if you prefer using pip3:
```python

3. Follow the interactive prompts:
